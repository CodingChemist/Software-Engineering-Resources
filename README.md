## Main Resources
The following resources list in this section were courses or materials that helped me build a major part of my foundation as a programmer.

One thing of note is that there's a lot of overlap in the CS topics they cover which is intentional. A lot of these topics are difficult to grasp initially, and I found while learning them, that I was to gain a much stronger understanding of each topic if I learned about it from them from multiple sources.


### Khan Academy: Computer Programming
* This is a really great resource for anyone just starting out and was integral to my success as a newbie. The lessons here are very simple, they cater to learners of all ages and don’t assume any kind of background in programming. The instructor, Pamela, is really great at breaking down relatively complex concepts in a way such that they’re incredibly easy to understand. The only issue I had with these tutorials was the Object-Oriented Programming section in the introduction to JavaScript, I found it a bit difficult to understand.

### Harvard’s CS50
* CS50 was a really helpful resource when I was beginning to learn about concepts like algorithms and data structures, as well as the importance of memory management (even in scripting languages like JavaScript). It also covers the basics of things like hexadecimals in color coding, very basic encryption, and programming techniques like traversing multidimensional arrays using nested for-loops (Sounds way more difficult than it really is). The big issue I have with this course is that it gets really really hard really quickly for a course that is marketed towards total beginners. At times I found the instructors to move too fast during the homework tutorials, and I found that reaching out to the Facebook and Reddit groups often left me more confused than I was before.

* My course recommendations:
 - CS50's rule that you shouldn’t look at anyone else’s solutions to create your own to the homework problems isn't really indicative of how the software development field works. If you are not taking this course in for credit/to get the certificate, I would recommend timeboxing how long you'll work on a homework problem before searching for other people's solutions on Google. **DON'T** copy and paste their solutions, that won't help you learn at all.try to reason you way through their solution, be sure that their solution makes sense to you, and then try to find an alternative solution to the problem using what you have learned from theirs. Bonus points if you can come up with a solution that is more efficient.
 - While the class lectures and shorts are great, you’ll likely have to look at outside resources like the BaseCS series to reinforce what you’re learning about CS fundamentals from this class. If you're new to programming, I would highly recommend taking Khan Academy's computer programming course first.
 - Take many many breaks while working through this course. Most people do not finish CS50 quickly, and it's okay to work through it over weeks and months.

### CodeNewbie and BaseCS
* I sincerely wish I had discovered this resource much much sooner in my coding journey. **Codenewbie** is a podcast/blog/community that follows real people on their journey to becoming better software developers. The main podcast features talks with various people in the field giving advice or testimonials on how specific technologies work, what they have learned from working with specific tools, and loads of other cool stuff. The episodes are usually 45 mins to an hour long.

 The **BaseCS** podcast is similar to the main podcast, however each episode is shorter and the entire focus is on the foundations of computer science taught by Vaidehi Joshi. The BaseCS podcast is incredibly helpful for learning the kind of computer science fundamentals that I personally struggled to understand elsewhere. And finally, there’s the community, it’s most active on twitter, but there’s also a facebook group which I have found to be incredibly useful and encouraging as a beginner.

### The Net Ninja
* I cannot recommend this channel enough. **The Net Ninja** is a a YouTube channel that covers a variety of topics throughout the web stack including frameworks like React and Vue. This channel really helped me cement my knowledge of Node.js and Graphql and also helped me through my coding bootcamp when I was learning MongoDB, Python, and Django.

* My resource rating: **5/5**


### Team Treehouse
  * **Team Treehouse** is a really good resource for learning specific technologies and tools in the web and mobile development space. Their library has courses in all of the major scripting/high-level languages as well as some courses in lower level ones like Java, Swift, and Objective-C. They also have courses on Git version control, Linux console foundations, HTTP and other networking protocols, and even how to choose a text editor.  

  I also found this to be a really good choice for helping me to nail down object-oriented programming, as well as for learning Node.js, jQuery, and how AJAX and JSON both work. My main problem with this resource was that I felt that the cost of $25 a month for just a basic membership seems too expensive to me especially when compared to many of the Udemy courses that are out there.


### FunFunFunction w/MPJ
* Another really great YouTube channel, he mainly focuses on JavaScript but he has videos that cover a few other things like Test Driven Development, Haskell, and his opinions on various technologies as a veteran in the field. I personally learned a lot from his series of videos on JavaScript Functional Programming, Advanced Object-Oriented Programming, and ES6 features. He can get a little too abstract for newbies (which he acknowledges as most of his videos are meant to be for intermediate to advanced programmers), but if you already have a good grounding in programming, especially in JavaScript, his channel is really useful.

* My resource rating: **4/5**



### The Coding Train by Daniel Shiffman
* A really good resource for tutorials on JavaScript. Most of his videos have a focus on programming as it applies to art work using the P5.js library, however his “Working with Data", “TwitterBot”, and "ES6" playlists are the courses I believe have the most valuex. The biggest problem for me is that Daniel has a certain awkwardness on camera and he makes a lot of uncomfortable, self-deprecating jokes that can be distracting during the videos.

## Supplemental Resources:
The resources in this category were courses, videos, and articles that I found to be very helpful while learning to program, however, in many cases they were not necessarily integral to my foundations as a software engineer.


### Web Developer Roadmap
* A pretty good guide on what to learn to achieve your goals as a developer. Take note, this roadmap is good suggestion for anyone who doesn’t know what to learn, but don’t take it as the law. If you want to learn a technology that isn’t on this list or is further down the path then suggested, do it. You’ll learn best by following your own curiosity rather than someone else’s list (Including the one I have made here).


### C Programming Tutorials and MyCodeSchool
*  These two channels really helped me break down some of the harder parts of programming as beginner in C and I would highly recommend watching their videos while working through doing CS50:

### Eloquent JavaScript
* A very in depth book on how Javascript works at its lowest level. I would not recommend this course for beginners, however I believe it's a great read to tackle once you have become  somewhat advanced at programming in JavaScript.

### Stack Overflow
* Essentially the Yahoo Answers of programming but people actually use it. Generally speaking, if you have a question about something related to programming, someone has asked it and had it answered here. The biggest drawback is that it can be a bit beginner unfriendly as the stackoverflow community can be quiet toxic at times.

### HackReactor Prep
* A crucial resource if you are planning on attending a coding bootcamp in the near future. This course requires that you learn and pratices numerous mini-javasript algorithms. It's super helpful if you are attending a bootcamp that has a technical screen.

## Coding Games

### Flexbox Froggy
 * A game that introduces you to CSS’s amazing flexbox functionality and how to use it to arrange elements in your front end applications.
